                <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                <p style={{display: 'block'}}>my name is dylan windebank and i have recently graduated with a b.s. in computer science from the university of north texas. 
                during my time there, i competed on the rocket league team for the university and broadened my programming knowledge. 
                i am currently a software developer intern at long drive agency but i am looking for a full-time position elsewhere. </p>
                <p style={{display: 'block'}}>what really got me into programming was videogames. before my time at university it was a struggle 
                to find a field that was not only technical, but an outlet of creativity. taking my first programming class in highschool (hoping i would learn how to make videogames),
                my curiosity was peaked from how much more to programming there is and i found my path.</p>
